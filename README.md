GEANT 4 Simulator for a scintillating puck and SiPM being hit by cosmic rays. Working on finding the amount of photons absorbed 
by the SiPM and the voltage for different energy muons.

# GEANT4 Scintillator-SiPM Simulation
This is an undergraduate research project done during Spring 2020 under David Stuart of UCSB. The goal of the project was to explore simulation by utilizing the software toolkit of GEANT4.
I aimed to see if I could determine the energy of the cosmic ray based on the amount of photons which hit the silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) on the side of the scintillator
puck or cube. I also carried out other tests including creating a heat map of the face of the puck based on the mean number of photons which hit the SiPM and
the amount of photons which hit the SiPM when the angle from the zenith is varied.
